##  Tests

This package uses testthat for testing. Please try to provide 100% test coverage for any submitted code and always check that existing tests continue to pass.  If you are a beginner and need help with writing a test, mention this in the issue and we will try to help.

## Pull requests

Pull requests should be against the _develop_ branch not the master branch. You can set this when creating your pull request. Please make a separately named branch to submit. Keep each branch for a complete specific issue. If you create a pull request by editing in the github web editor and you end up with multiple pull requests, note that in your issue comments.

## Code style

Besides that, in general follow the [tidyverse style](http://style.tidyverse.org/) style for R.
